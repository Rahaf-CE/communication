# ðŸ“¡ Communication Systems Project: Spectrum & MSE Analysis

This repository contains code and analysis for a project in **ENEE 3309 - Communication Systems**, focused on evaluating the **Mean Square Error (MSE)** and **signal spectrum** for different values of the parameter `k`.



## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

- Compute the **MSE** for signal processing conditions where \( k = 1, 2, 3 \).
- Analyze and compare the **frequency spectrum** of the resulting signals.
- Visualize how increasing the value of `k` affects signal accuracy and spectral characteristics.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Components

### 1. **MSE Calculation**

### 2. **Spectrum Analysis**
- Use **FFT** to calculate and plot the magnitude spectrum.
- Observe the energy distribution and bandwidth variation as `k` increases.

## ðŸ§ª Tools and Technologies

- Python / MATLAB
- NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy (for Python version)
- FFT algorithms for spectral analysis
